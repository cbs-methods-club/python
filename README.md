# Python Methods Club
Collection of resources from our monthly Python Methods Club at [MPI CBS](https://www.cbs.mpg.de). 

This repository is based on the tool [Knowledge Repo](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo). 
More information regarding the usage of knowledge repo can be found in the [knowledge_repo.md](knowledge_repo.md) 

## Questions, discussions and requests

Please post any questions you would like to be answered in a future session as an [issue](https://github.com/cbs-methods-club/python-methods-club/issues). This way we can all discuss how to integrate this into a session (or possibly answer the question in the process). You may also use this system to generally request or even offer topics. Please also indicate your interest in a topic by either participating in the discussion or by "liking" the topic (give a thumbs up, +1 or whatever you prefer).

## The next session. 

[Milestones](https://github.com/cbs-methods-club/python-methods-club/milestones) are used to mark, which topics should be included in a specific future session. The due-date of the milestone marks the date of the session.
